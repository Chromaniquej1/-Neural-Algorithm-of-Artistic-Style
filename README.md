# Neural-Algorithm-of-Artistic-Style
Neural style transfer (NST) is a very neat idea. NST builds on the key idea that,Following this concept, NST employs a pretrained convolution neural network (CNN) to transfer styles from a given image to another. This is done by defining a loss function that tries to minimise the differences between a content image, a style image and a generated image, which will be discussed in detail later. By the end of this tutorial you will be able to create very cool artwork like below.
